Plan:
1. Implement and use unit.Interface, system.Interface
2. Implement system.Manager struct with a Getter interface(instance of system) field
3. Change test package names to $package\_test
4. Mock interfaces, continue writing tests
5. Use a custom [logger](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) ?

- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Systemctl output formatting(tabwriter)
- [ ] Systemctl help, descriptions
- [ ] Target units
- [ ] Modify constants to better match Systemd
- [ ] Make Systemgo run on Browsix
- [ ] Allow for way of communicating with init other than HTTP
